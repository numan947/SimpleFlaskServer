A simple easily customizable Flask Server which can be used with ImageDataCollector project. This can work as a very simple backend that receives and stores the images sent by the ImageDataCollector and if configured can handle classification and training on the serverside.

TODO:
1. Add simple documentation.
2. Add guidelines for modifying the application.
